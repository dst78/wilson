# Wilson :: Sample and Hold

## Internal trimming abilities

- T1 noise amplification
- T2 noise transposition

Tweak these until the noise out is in the -5V to 5V range.

- T3 S&H amplification

Tweak this until the S&H out is in the -5V to 5V range when the output attenuator is fully open.


## External Connections

- Input jack for external triggers (normalled to internal clock)
- Input jack for external sampling source (normalled to noise)
- Output jack for noise
- Output jack for S&H signal

- Potentiometer for internal clock rate adjustment
- Potentiometer for S&H transposition (shifts possible voltage range up/down)
- Potentiometer for output attenuation (attenuates voltage range, not volume)


## What's in the name?

The module was named in honor of Nobel price laureates Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.
